## About Me 👩🏻‍🦱
<hr>
I recently graduated with a Master's Degree majoring in Information Technology. While studying, I also worked as a software developer (student worker) for about two years, quietly pulling the strings behind the scenes. In simple terms Backend/Software Developer. I have practical experience working on academic projects involving AWS, NLP, databases, front-end and backend development tools and technologies. Take a peek into the following sections to uncover the secret origins of my skills. 🕵🏻

Now, I've set my sights on database roles because, hey, I've taken some serious courses like Data Visualization, Big Data Analytics, and Advanced DBMS – call it the academic survival kit! 💻

I'm on the lookout for Data Engineering/Analytics roles because, honestly, my academic adventures have turned me into a data enthusiast. Give me a shot, and I'll show you what I've got.💫
